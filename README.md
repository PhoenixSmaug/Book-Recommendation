# A Comparison of Recommendation Algorithms

The aim of this repository is to compare different recommendation algorithms on the [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data). The analysis is performed with the Python library [LensKit](https://lenskit.org/) in a Jupyter notebook. The following algorithms are compared:

* Alternating Least Squares

* Funk Singular Value Decomposition

* k Nearest Neighbour Collaborative Filtering
